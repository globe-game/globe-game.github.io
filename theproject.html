		<h1>What is G.L.O.B.E.?</h1>

		<p>Yeah, that's right!</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>The game</h2>
		<p>G.L.O.B.E. is a fun family racing game, like 'Mario Kart'.</p>
		<p>Compete against artificial intelligence or your friends in a variety of circuits, with vehicles each crazier than the others!</p>
		<p>Try to make a reputation for yourself on the circuit, and finally become the number 1!</p>

		<br>

		<h2>The vehicles</h2>

		<p>Most of the vehicles will still be very familiar to you!</p>
		<p>All vehicles will be accessible from the beginning.</p>
		<p>It goes from the simple lowpoly car to the racing car, through... a truck???</p>
		<p>Gotta catch 'em all! Uh, not the right game. Gotta TEST them all, and choose the one that will take you straight to victory!</p>

		<p>Admire this beautiful racing car, it is called Alabama. Oh and this is Espada, with which you will start your adventure. And finally, Chouf, the truck with the greatest pride in the world.</p>


		<br>
		<h2>The circuits</h2>
		<p>Okay, we have vehicles, but where do we drive?</p>
		<p>G.L.O.B.E. has no less than three completely different circuits, all filled with references of all kinds.</p>
		<p>Each circuit has a shortcut, more complicated to take, but which will make you save time (yes I know it's the definition of a shortcut).</p>
		<p>The first circuit, Dio, takes place in a desert environment full of references to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.</p>

		<p>The second tour, Ice Age, takes you right into the Christmas season.</p>

		<p>Finally, Poke will take you through grass and rock, an environment that would be pretty standard, if the track wasn't invaded by Pok√©mon.</p>

		<h2>Artificial intelligence (single player mode)</h2>
		<p>You really want to play but you don't have any friends? No problem!</p>
		<p>Play solo against the artificial intelligence.</p>
		<p>The AI is designed to dodge obstacles in an optimal way.</p>
		<p>The AI follows a predefined path, so don't waste time in the background, the AI won't wait for you!</p>

		<h2>Multiplayer mode</h2>
		<p>Did you manage to convince your friends to play G.L.O.B.E.? Well done, I didn't succeed myself.</p>
		<p>The game has a "room" system. A player creates a room, and all other players can see it and join it.</p>
		<p>There you are! Go ahead, and may the best player win!</p>
