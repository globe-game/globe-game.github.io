		<h1>What is G.L.O.B.E.?</h1>

		<p>Yeah, that's right!</p>
		
		<br>
		<h2>The game</h2>
		<p>G.L.O.B.E. is a fun family racing game, like 'Mario Kart'.</p>
		<p>Compete against artificial intelligence or your friends in a variety of circuits, with vehicles each crazier than the others!</p>
		<p>Travel around Astra and try to make a reputation for yourself on the circuit, and finally become the number 1!</p>

		<br>
		<h2>The story</h2>
		<p>Planet Astra, 900 years in the future. Human beings have been forced to leave the Earth due to a sudden acceleration of global warming.</p>
		<p>Despite this, and while trying to limit the pollution of their new habitat, humans have not given up the speed of their vehicles.</p>
		<p>G.L.O.B.E. is a worldwide competition bringing together the most powerful vehicles on the planet.</p>
		<p>Competitions bring in a lot of money, both for the participants and the organizers.</p>
		<p>The races take place in the four corners of this globe 2.0.</p>


		<br>

		<h2>The vehicles</h2>

		<p>The technology has evolved, but don't worry, most of the vehicles will still be very familiar to you!</p>
		<p>You will start your adventure with a charming low poly car. Its name is Espada.</p>
		<p>With the money you earn from winning races, you will be able to purchase new vehicles.</p>
		<p>And for the occasion, the inhabitants of Astra knew how to show originality!<p>
		<p>It goes from the simple go-kart to the futuristic car, through... a 'grand bi'???</p>
		<p>Gotta catch 'em all! Uh, not the right game. Gotta BUY them all, and choose the one that will take you straight to victory!</p>
		<br>

		<h2>The currency</h2>

		<h2>Artificial intelligence (single player mode)</h2>
		<p>You really want to play but you don't have any friends? No problem!</p>
		<p>Play solo against the artificial intelligence.</p>
		<p>The AI is designed to dodge obstacles in an optimal way.</p>
		<p>The AI follows a predefined path, so don't waste time in the background, the AI won't wait for you!</p>

		<h2>Multiplayer mode</h2>
		<p>Did you manage to convince your friends to play G.L.O.B.E.? Well done, I didn't succeed myself.</p>
		<p>The game has a "room" system. A player creates a room, and all other players can see it and join it.</p>
		<p>There you are! Go ahead, and may the best player win!</p>
