		<h1>The different steps of the G.L.O.B.E. conception.</h1>

		<p>A game can't be made in an hour.</p>
		<p>So to better understand how the game is made, here is a summary of the steps of its conception.</p>
		<br>


		<h2>The idea of a racing game</h2>
		<p>For this project, the group did not form in a logical way. Satya and Vincent were already together, and joined the group formed by Sami and Hugo.</p>
		<p>Indeed, Hugo already had the idea of a 3D racing game, and approached Sami. Vincent and Satya liked the idea and we were ready to go.</p>
		<p>Then we had our first divergence: cartoon game like Mario Kart, or futuristic game like F-Zero?</p>
		<p>After consultation with the members, it was decided to go for the first option, in order to allow more fantasy possibilities during the development.</p>
		<p>The final result is a hybrid of the two in its physics.</p>
		<br>


		<h2>First steps on Unity, first physics problems</h2>

		<p>To develop the game, we had the choice between two engines: Unity and Godot.</p>
		<p>We instantly chose Unity, because of the incredible documentation it has on the internet (blogs, forums, video tutorials).</p>
		<p>Once this was decided, we could move on to the game development.</p>
		<p>The first thing in a racing game is the car. And the car must drive.</p>
		<p>So we practiced creating travel scripts, by using cars found on the internet.</p>
		<p>Our first difficulties were to make the vehicle turn, as well as the camera.</p>
		<p>More details on the physics coming soon.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>The vehicles conception</h2>
		<p>Still for its documentation, our choice was quickly Blender for the design of vehicles and other 3D models.</p>
		<p>Knowing absolutely nothing about the software, it took a long time to finalize the first vehicle: Espada.</p>
		<p>More details on the vehicules conception coming soon.</p>
		<br>


		<h2>The menus</h2>
		<p>When you start a racing game, do you already appear behind the wheel? Of course not!</p>
		<p>To make the menus, we used the "Canvas" object of Unity, on which we affixed buttons and other texts one after one.</p>
		<p>It was necessary to position the hitbox of the buttons in relation to the texts, to make appear the good menus at the good moment, and to pass from a scene to the other with these menus.</p>
		<p>More details on the menus coming soon.</p>
		<br>


		<h2>The artificial intelligence</h2>
		<p>The player will not be alone on the circuit! This is not Trackmania.</p>
		<p>There are two important aspects of AI: vehicle trajectory and obstacle management.</p>
		<p>You don't want the car to get stuck against a cactus on the road, but you also don't want the vehicle to go off into the landscape.</p>
		<p>More details on the artificial intelligence coming soon.</p>
		<br>


		<h2>The multiplayer mode</h2>
		<p>A good racing game must have a good multiplayer mode, to compete with friends or prove to the world that you are the best.</p>
		<p>Multiplayer is managed by the Photon 2 asset, which accepts up to 20 players connected simultaneously.</p>
		<p>The first difficulty was to understand the new functions associated with Photon.</p>
		<p>So that several races can take place at the same time, it was necessary to manage the creation of "rooms".</p>
		<p>After making the necessary menus to create and join rooms, it was necessary to make the players appear on the circuit.</p>
		<p>The most difficult problem to solve in this game was that the appearance of vehicles on spawn points was randomly managed, sometimes causing two vehicles to appear on top of each other.</p>
		<p>More details on the multiplayer mode coming soon.</p>
